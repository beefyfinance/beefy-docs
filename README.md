## What is Beefy?

Beefy is a Decentralized, Multichain Yield Optimizer that allows its users to earn compound interest on their crypto holdings. Beefy earns you the highest APYs with safety and efficiency in mind.

Through a set of investment strategies secured and enforced by smart contracts, Beefy automatically maximizes the user rewards from various liquidity pools (LPs),‌ ‌automated market making (AMM) projects,‌ ‌and‌ ‌other yield‌ farming ‌opportunities in the DeFi ecosystem.

The main product offered by Beefy Finance are the Vaults in which you stake your crypto tokens. The investment strategy tied to the Vault will automatically increase your deposited token amount by compounding arbitrary yield farm reward tokens back into your initially deposited asset. Despite the name Vault suggests, your funds are never locked in any Vault on Beefy: you can always withdraw at any moment in time.

DeFi applications are unique in the sense that they are permissionless and trustless, meaning that anyone with a supported wallet can interact with them without the need for a trusted middleman. While you have funds staked in a vault, you remain 100% in control of your crypto.

## What is BIFI?

BIFI is the multiutility token of Beefy. The utility is twofold: BIFI stakers earn a part of the revenue generated by Beefy, and both holders and stakers are entitled to vote on important governance decisions.

For all the vaults deployed on every blockchain, Beefy has its multiutility token BIFI at its core. Platform revenue is generated from a small percentage of all the vault profits and distributed back to those who stake BIFI.

The revenue sharing mechanics entail you can stake BIFI to either earn more BIFI in a BIFI Maxi Vault, or earn blue chips like ETH, BNB, FTM, MATIC, AVAX, and more in the BIFI Earnings Pools.

The supply of BIFI is limited at 80,000 tokens and available on various exchanges such as Binance, 1inchexchange and PancakeSwap.
