# How to bridge BIFI cross-chain

As a true multichain token, BIFI can be staked to earn a share of Beefy's revenue on _every_ chain integrated by Beefy. Each chain holds different opportunities for staking your BIFI, just check out the different APYs of the chain's BIFI Maxi vault!&#x20;

## Prerequisites

* You need to have the current and destination network configured in your Metamask.
* You will need the current and destination chain's native gas token to pay for transaction fees.

## Walkthrough

You may bridge BIFI from any of the support networks. As an example, we are going to bridge BIFI from Fantom to Cronos in this guide.

### 1. Visit [https://anyswap.exchange/#/router](https://anyswap.exchange/#/router)

### 2. Switch network to Fantom and connect your wallet
