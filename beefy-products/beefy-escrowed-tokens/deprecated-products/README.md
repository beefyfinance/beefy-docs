# Deprecated Products

This section contains legacy documentation for Beefy-escrowed products that have been subsequently retired or deprecated.

In many cases, it is neither feasible nor appropriate to fully disable token-based products from on-chain operations. However, continued support within Beefy’s protocol, infrastructure, and user interface may become economically impractical. In such instances, Beefy discontinues active support and maintenance of these products.

While no longer supported, some of these products may still be accessible through alternative means—for example, through residual liquidity on decentralized exchanges.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is not advisable to transact with any deprecated Beefy-escrowed products outside of the Beefy UI, and doing so can lead to permanent and undesirable loss of capital. Always research our products before investing, and raise questions or concerns through Beefy's public spaces and social media channels.
