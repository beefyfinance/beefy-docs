# Oracle Contracts

Oracles are services which feed external data into blockchain ecosystems, for use by smart contracts across various functionalities. By far the largest use of oracles in Web 3.0 is price feed oracles, which help to provide a source of truth for the price of assets that do not have a local or reliable pricing mechanism that can be used.

Beefy's core products do not fundamentally rely on oracles for their ordinary operations. Unlike lending markets, which need rely fully on accurate pricing for protocol health (i.e. to enforce liquidations), ordinary deviations in the price of assets managed by Beefy smart contracts do not expose those assets to material risks in the ordinary course of our operations. As such, Beefy's reliance on oracles is safely constrained.

That notwithstanding, oracles provide a convenient means of optimising functionality across our systems for actions like swaps and pricing for our app.

### Chainlink Oracles

Chainlink provides a range of oracles to support Beefy's products across a number of chains:

**mooBIFI**

* Sonic: 0xc9541134848f525f8eaEA262599a1668A3a9b6eD
* Base: 0x721F1B4dc604AEA0661Aa9982AB624e5756B31f2
* Op: 0x4244c9aE5B97269B7301B622E22932FA49fBb763

**beS**

* Sonic: 0x15643d909F07e4083fCE3e3204F7e1A0A37D52f4

These oracles provide accurate and tamper-resistant prices, allowing Beefy's various tokens to be used in different applications across DeFi.
