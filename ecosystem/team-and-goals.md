# Team & Goals

## When was Beefy.Finance launched?

Beefy was born on September 21, 2020, the day our [governance distribution contracts](https://medium.com/beefyfinance/bifi-contracts-are-live-on-mainnet-6080577269d7) went live. Our first set of vaults opened on October 8, 2020.

## How is Beefy organized?

Beefy is a decentralized working hub for people with a vision to come together and build the future of global finance. Smart contract devs, UI, UX, strategists, statisticians, designers, and artists - anyone can join and contribute (no matter your nationality, sex, or views). By investing in Beefy, you are investing in the idea that a group of highly technical individuals can safely, securely and creatively leapfrog the dinosaurs of traditional finance.

## Why is the project anonymous?

Personalities get in the way of projects, and we believe Beefy speaks for itself. By having a team that operates anonymously, even amongst itself, we can focus on providing the best experience for our users. That’s because we believe the strength of Beefy comes from what we build, which is an opportunity for investors to both automate AND maximize the ROI of their holdings. We urge anyone with concerns that anonymity diminishes credibility to join our Discord community (link) and get a first-hand feeling for the strength and depth of the project.

## How can I get in touch with Beefy?

Our global community managers and team members can be contacted anytime through our official [Telegram](https://t.me/beefyfinance) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/yq8wfHd) channels. We should mention that generally speaking within investment communities there are some bad actors around looking to scam, phish, or maliciously target users. Please double check the validity of whoever you talk to, and remember that no one representing Beefy will ever ask you to provide wallet keys or recovery codes.

## What’s your relationship with Binance Smart Chain?

The platform began life on the Binance Smart Chain network as one of the very first Yield Optimizers, but is evolving into a multi-chain ecosystem. BSC was our only home for many months, and helped us kickstart our growth. While it’s our highest chain by TVL, the gap keeps shrinking as our decentralized army of contributors looks for the best available yield in the multi-chain ecosystem.
