## What is JOE? <a href="#what-is-joe" id="what-is-joe"></a>

JOE is the native token of Trader Joe, a decentralized exchange on Avalanche. It rewards holders with a share of the platform’s revenues and also acts as a governance token. JOE has a fixed supply and decaying emission model.

Users can stake JOE to earn veJOE and receive boosted JOE rewards in selected Trader Joe Farms and governance voting power.

## What is beJOE?

beJOE is a Beefy-wrapped version of JOE staked to earn veJOE, maximizing emissions on boosted Beefy vaults. beJOE stakers earn 5% of emissions from those boosted vaults.&#x20;

The token is fully backed 1:1 by JOE and can be redeemed for JOE held in reserve. This reserve only fills up when a new user deposits.

## How does one get beJOE?

You can mint beJOE on the beJOE Vault page at a 1:1 ratio. There will be no incentivised liquidity for beJOE, instead there will be a withdrawal reserve.

## How does beJOE work?

If JOE reserves are above the sufficient amount then Beefy will stake 80% of the deposited JOE to earn veJOE and hold 20% in the withdrawal reserve. For every boosted vault, Beefy will divert 5% of the harvest to the beJOE reward pool.

As users deposit more JOE, Beefy will hold them back until we activate a Speed Up bonus on veJOE. This will occur in increments of 5% of the total amount currently staked in veJOE.

If JOE reserves are low then all of the deposited JOE will be used to fill up the reserves.&#x20;

## What can I do with beJOE? <a href="#what-can-i-do-with-bejoe" id="what-can-i-do-with-bejoe"></a>

Once you’re holding beJOE, there are a couple of available options. You can either stake it in the:

1. Vault to earn more beJOE
2. Earnings pool to earn JOE

## But what about fees? <a href="#but-what-about-fees" id="but-what-about-fees"></a>

Beefy has the lowest yield-optimizing fees on Avalanche. With Beefy’s new beJOE boosted farms, you earn more than anywhere else. Beefy charges its normal 4.5% performance fees on boosted vaults plus an additional 5% delivered directly to beJOE stakers.

## How does beJOE keep its peg?

There's no liquidity provided for beJOE, so it will always be at 1:1 with JOE. Users can burn beJOE for JOE while the reserve lasts. This reserve only fills up when a new user deposits.

In a last-resort scenario, all locked JOE in beJOE can be unlocked and released to the reserve. Beefy's competitors do not have this. However this would also end the boosts available for Beefy vaults and the rewards streamed to the beJOE reward pool, so is unlikely to be triggered.

## Can I vote with beJOE? <a href="#vejoe-model" id="vejoe-model"></a>

Not yet, but beJOE implements EIP-1271 (signature validation for contracts), so future governance/bribes with TraderJoe can be organised.
