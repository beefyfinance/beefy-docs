# FryWorld

## Active Vaults

**2020-10-12** 

* Added FRIES farming support for BUSD, WBNB and BURGERS

Majority of the yield farming revenue is returned to users who provide capital. The remaining yield farming revenue is distributed to users who stake their BIFI in the [reward pool](https://gov.beefy.finance/stake), as well as used to pay the gas of harvests calls. A 0.1% fee is applied to all withdrawals. This is to prevent bad actors from 'gaming' the system.



## Farming FRIES with BURGERS

This strategy farms FRIES, the [Fry.World Platform token](https://fry.world/)

{% hint style="info" %}
You do not receive FRIES directly. Instead, the farmed FRIES are sold to return more BURGERS to you when you withdraw.
{% endhint %}
