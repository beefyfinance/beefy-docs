# Beefy Backup

![](../.gitbook/assets/safu.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Both [app.beefy.com](https://app.beefy.com/) and [app.beefy.finance](https://app.beefy.finance) are official Beefy websites. If one does not work for you, try the other.
{% endhint %}

Sporadically, users are experiencing white screens, or blank screens, and can not access the Beefy app.

This might be due to Fleek or Cloudflare undergoing maintenance or outages, but it's hard to pinpoint the root cause. When it happens, it does usually not affect everyone but only some regions world wide. We understand that this can be frustrating!

First and foremost, _don't worry_, your funds are always SAFU on the blockchain, they are not on Beefy's website. The site is only a frontend to let you access your funds easily.

If you are experiencing the aforementioned issues, try the following official mirror: [https://app.beefy.eth.limo/#/](https://app.beefy.eth.limo/#/). Using a VPN will generally help as well.

The mirror is a developer's build, which we can provide as a backup for users that can't access Beefy's site.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember, seed phrases and private keys will **never** be asked on any of Beefy's official sites. Stay vigilant!
