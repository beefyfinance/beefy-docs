# Bug Bounty Program

Our developers typically conduct rigorous internal tests and evaluate blockchain contracts before deployment. Beefy has also been [audited](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-audits) by security organisation [CertiK](https://www.certik.com/projects/beefyfinance). Furthermore, the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." - this is a key Beefy principle.

However, in order to guarantee a top level security for your deposits, one can never be too careful. That's why Beefy has launched a bug bounty program with ImmuneFi. On Immunefi, white hat hackers secure DeFi contracts, save funds from theft, and get paid doing it.

The bug bounty program covers Beefy's smart contracts and apps and is focused on the prevention of the following:

* Significant Vault hack/exploit;
* Theft of Governance Funds;
* Website down/DDOS attack.
