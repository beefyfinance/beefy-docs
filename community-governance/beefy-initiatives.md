# Beefy Initiatives

Though our focus at Beefy is squarely on safely optimising your yield, we're always open to new opportunities and initiatives in Web 3.0. Through its life, Beefy has supported a number of projects, whether aimed at developing Beefy's own products, expanding the brand into new markets, or creating entirely new products by leveraging our expertise or Cowmoonity spirit. This page overviews some of the amazing initiatives that Beefy has been involved with.

## Beefy V2 :desktop:

One of the earliest examples of Beefy initiatives was the V2 website. As early as March 2021, governance [proposals](https://vote-archive.beefy.finance/#/beefy/proposal/QmUmnXWJwDQwTDehqdGZAtfwFPHKc2zu6VVs58kfyNpaLZ) were put forward seeking funding to develop a V2 using external resource. Ultimately, these efforts were brought in house by a further [proposal](https://vote-archive.beefy.finance/#/beefy/proposal/QmYv4xEip2VZ6gBzJgsVSZ4c1UvK4itMDbpYrghuAn9r83) in October 2021, with the Core team completing the job. Though V2 had been in beta since late 2021, the site finally went live on 27 March 2022.

## Moonpot :full\_moon:

[Moonpot](https://play.moonpot.com/#/moonpots) is a win-win savings game powered by Beefy. The core Moonpot dev team has significant overlap with the Beefy Core, and launched through Beefy. The game allows users to deposit their assets in vaults, both to earn interest and receive tickets for participating in regular prize draws. This provides users with a new way to use their assets, and supports a number of Beefy products such as our BIFI token and some of our mooVaults (e.g. binSPIRIT).&#x20;

Moonpot was initially seeded with funding from Beefy, by way of a [proposal](https://vote-archive.beefy.finance/#/beefy/proposal/Qmad6g5vMA8bS2axxeh7a1LqD61k6mtBjDrrTVgdDqeAN7) passed on 16 May 2021. Beefy allocated an initial $50,000, to be provided to the Beefy team seeking to launch Moonpot, in return for a share of the proceeds once Moonpot starting generating revenue. The project launched in July 2021, and has enjoyed significant success. The Moonpot team continues to be close friends of the Beefy Cowmoonity.

## BeefyGrants :moneybag:

As mentioned in [#grants-and-initiatives](../community/contributor-compensation.md#grants-and-initiatives "mention"), BeefyGrants were introduced by Beefy founder Sirbeefalot as a framework for incentivising new development efforts. In a [paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hBnQcbxkRvhmHASqivI3g8rBS\_4m4mmTaT\_jW4VjE7c/edit) and blog post introducing the idea, Sirbeefalot explained that the system would be aimed at giving direction to Beefy's development efforts, creating a virtuous cycle of fund allocation, and fairly rewarding community members for their contributions.&#x20;

The initial plan outlined a batch of grants, where community members could apply for a portion of a $50,000 grant allocation by submitting a "Yes/No" proposal for Cowmoonity voting. Projects would be allocated in order of highest margin of "Yes" votes until the fund was exhausted. A BeefyGrants [proposal](https://vote-archive.beefy.finance/#/beefy/proposal/QmafULDojJ4StzJtuwjBZutnUkzb9TUhTLCLZe5R7deWLo) was unanimously adopted by the Cowmoonity on 20 September 2021. The programme was successful, and a range of proposals were launched in early October 2021, including to create the Beefy Bridge, fund documentation updates and app localisation efforts, develop a Beefy Tracker, incentivise mooBIFI lending and sponsor Beefy events.

Since the initial wave of grants, a few further applications have been made for other initiatives, and a full list of all of the successful grant applications is included below. Today, BeefyGrants remain an option for contributors seeking support and funding for their initiatives. Details of how to participate are included in the[#get-involved](beefy-initiatives.md#get-involved "mention")section below.

## Beefy Bridge :bridge\_at\_night:

The Beefy Bridge was initially proposed in the first round of BeefyGrants, as an addition to the Beefy UI that would use Anyswap (now Multichain) to faciliate the bridge on the backend. The aim was to increase the user's multichain experience and enable them to perform all the functions they might need to use Beefy's products from within Beefy's site.&#x20;

The grant [proposal](https://vote-archive.beefy.finance/#/beefy/proposal/QmRrBSXseRz2ESvxn4yz9bndx6jQTQrEMouKcqqUGFKYQX) received unanimous support and passed on 13 October 2021. After months of tireless development and testing work by the Beefy Core, the bridge was finally launched on 7 June 2022. The initial version facilitates BIFI transfers between each of Beefy's chains.&#x20;

## Beefy Battles :crossed\_swords:

Beefy Battles is a Play2Earn GameFi project proposed by a loyal Cowmoonity member. The planned game allows players to battle against other players with their chosen minions, and enter into tournaments to compete for prizes and glory. Current plans include a shop for trading rare and valuable items with other players, as well as some interesting interfaces with Beefy and its BIFI token. A [proposal](https://vote-archive.beefy.finance/#/beefy/proposal/QmXK1JCTvKz9PEUidmKe9GXD2Gx4jetHKua11DpeZ6RoWc) for seed funding was passed on 9 November 2021.

## MooWars :cow:

Another interesting GameFi project which has received backing from the Cowmoonity is MooWars, a planned NFT trading card game where players battle their NFT herds for a chance to win their opponents cards. The game plans to launch with an initial mint of 80,000 NFT trading cards, to be minted in packs of 10.&#x20;

MooWars' creators, Moondance DAO, put forward a [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beefydao.eth/proposal/0x19e5ef2e5c0833dbc5af39da1a0c3b92a94c4c461b089245abcf34af8e9fa3b2) offering the Cowmoonity to participate in the project with a few options for ownership. The proposal passed on 7 April 2022, with the Cowmoonity opting for the maximum stake in the project (40%). Further details of the project are available on the [MooWars website](https://www.moowars.com/).
